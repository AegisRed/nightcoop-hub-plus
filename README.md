# NightCoop hub — run your own server

*Русская версия инструкции — [tools/hub/docker/README.ru.md](tools/hub/docker/README.ru.md).*

The NightCoop hub is the small server that players of [NightCoop](https://nightcoop.net) (a co-op mod for Cyberpunk 2077)
meet through: it hands out session codes, helps two players behind home routers open a direct path to each other and relays
the game traffic when no direct path opens. The game itself is end-to-end encrypted between the players — the hub only
forwards sealed packets.

This repository holds only what the hub is built from. The mod itself is not here.

## Windows / Radmin VPN quick start

On Windows with Docker Desktop, use the guided [Windows setup](tools/hub/docker/README.windows.md)
([по-русски](tools/hub/docker/README.windows.ru.md)). It switches the hub to published UDP
ports, installs Windows Firewall rules with approval, and shows LAN/Radmin address examples
in the console. The Linux `network_mode: host` setup below is unchanged.

## Quick start (Docker)

```sh
cd tools/hub/docker
cp .env.example .env          # optional: port, threads, name, region
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs hub | grep fingerprint
```

Open UDP **47800** and **47810–47873**, then give your players the address with the fingerprint, for example
`hub.example.org#K3QF-9X2M-TV7A-0D4R`. In the game: the mod menu "Co-op" → "Server: …" → "Add an own server".
